__________
In this project we have created a Virtual Bank  using Python and MySQL. Data entered by the user are stored in MYSQL database in tabular form. Here  We have done CRUD Operation. The Best Part of this code is that it is 100 % user friendly because of excess use of exceptional handling.

This project is designed for The Bank Staffs to keep the record of their customers. Only authorized Users can have the accessibility to the program. User after Logging in have the support to display all records, and modify it accordingly. If someone is not having Login Id, password he/she could make a new id. Further it can also check overall record of a local customer or full detail of a single a/c as per transactions, create a new record for new customer, Update an old customer record, Delete a record of a customer and Update Loans of the customer. Python is used as Front End and MySQL is used as Back End.
